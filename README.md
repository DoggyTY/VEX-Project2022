# VEX-Project2022
 Project repository for team 8861F in ISB so that we can all access the same files and not work with trying to send files to each other.
 Notebook for the project at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B2LKZbUSHH6N762gV3rmFJzrw9JBZX8vE2Ez2UwjboA/edit?usp=sharing 

 Robot need to figure out where it is. (XYZ component.)
 How to find disks during automated section. (They are in set positions)
 
 STEPS ON AUTOMATION:
 1. We turn the closest roller
 2. Get the two or three disks nearest to the robot
 3. Shoot the disks into high goal from predetermand position.

 So we haven't really done anything here but basically we've wrote two files one for competition and another for testing, when we need to we port over the testing one to competetion
 for all intents and purposes the NullPointerException is the testing Folder and the Compete Folder is the final code
